### Multiple language support

# Module requirements

In this minor module, the objective is to ensure that your website supports multiple languages to cater to a diverse user base. Key features and goals include:

- Implement support for a minimum of three languages on the website to accommodate a broad audience.

  > Languages : Fallback to English. Otherwise, user can choose between English, German, French and Japanese.

- Provide a language switcher or selector that allows users to easily change the website’s language based on their preferences.

  > Note: Currently, extremenly basic selector. If time permits it, will work on a more modern/fancier one.

- Translate essential website content, such as navigation menus, headings, and key information, into the supported languages.

  > Note: Will also implement the translation of user-facing error messages to ensure better i18n compliance.

- Ensure that users can navigate and interact with the website seamlessly, regardless of the selected language.

- Consider using language packs or localization libraries to simplify the translation process and maintain consistency across different languages.

  > Note: Implementing own feature without library for learning purposes.

- Allow users to set their preferred language as the default for subsequent visits.
  > Note: Currently persistence is maintained using localStorage. Ultimately, will need to implement preferredLanguage in the DB.

This minor module aims to enhance the accessibility and inclusivity of your website by offering content in multiple languages, making it more user-friendly for a diverse international audience.
