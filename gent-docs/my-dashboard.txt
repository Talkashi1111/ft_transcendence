- pong.ts; Changed proprietes from private to protected to enable inheritence
- physics.ts

Additions:
- frontend/src/game/bot-pong.ts; bot class inheriting from PongGame; simulates an opponent with different difficulties/ai log

----------

Remarks:
- Which stage to push for the evaluation ? Decide when project is done
- Current favicon is default vite
- Before a game, the number of points required to win the match should be shown.
- 11 points to win a match is bit too much
