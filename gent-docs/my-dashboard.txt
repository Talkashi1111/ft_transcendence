TASKS OF NOW:
PR review
Plan Implementation I-am-human level;
- 1 view/second
- Predicts hit zone when ball moves toward bot
- after returning the place, the paddle places itself a little bit in the center (optional)

AI levels:
1. Paw patrol | done
2. Track-y | done
3. I-am-human; anticipate bounces, "view" the gamestate once per second | to-do
4. Hard; predicts ballhitpoint (?before the ball hits the player's paddle) | to-do
5. 2026; cheats, move left and right, multiple paddles, aggressive | optional

Main Task(s):
Introduce AI opponent; requirements (subjects);
  - provides a challenging and engaging gameplay for users
  - AI must replicate human behavior, which means that in your AI implementation, you must simulate keyboard input. The constraint here is that the AI can only refresh its view of the game once per second, requiring it to anticipate bounces and other actions.
  - Implement AI logic and decision-making processes that enable the AI player to make intelligent and strategic moves
  - Explore alternative algorithms and techniques to create an effective AI player without relying on A*
  - Ensure that the AI adapts to different gameplay scenarios and user interactions
Implement Tests for new feature

Remarks:
- Students can validate Transcendence before finishing circle 5
- Which stage to push for the evaluation ? Pending...
- What is expected from reviewers for a PR (in the context of transcendence) ?
- Current favicon is default vite
- Before a game, the number of points required to win the match should be shown

enquire to school:
 - If we can do transcendence v18. Is v18 evaluation available during the evaluation ?
